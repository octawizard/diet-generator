# Diet Generator
This is a little tool that helps you generate a balanced diet,
giving priorities to vegetables and including one protein source
and one carbohydrates source.

## FAQ

### What's the purpose
I created this tool to facilitate the organization of your main meals
during a week, in order to give an idea on what to eat every day.

### How does it look a generated diet
The diet propose a weekly plan, of two meals only, a lunch and a dinner.
For each meal, I tried to follow the rule of the
[healthy plate](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/).

In each genereated diet fruits are not included, neither breakfast or snacks;
most of the nutritionist recommends two portions per day, 
as a generic rule of thumb.

## Disclaimer

I **am not a nutritionist**, and I take no responsibility on any
diet usage. This tool is just meant to generate a diet proposition
that's supposed to be balanced.

If you have health issues, or you need a professional assistance,
please refer to a doctor or nutritionist.
